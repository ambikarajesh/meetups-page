              | This Meetup group will feature speakers from across the stack: topics will include DevOps, Programming (front-end & back-end), Data Modeling, Collaboration, and Scaling. And of course, we'll ask each speaker "what's in your stack?"

              | Because great software engineers aren't "Java guys" or "HTML5 ninjas," we're problem solvers. We take an idea and build it end to end: from just above the bare-metal, through the OS, db, server, network, and browser, and all the way up to the user. We collaborate, code, configure, and deploy. Full-stack engineers are a new breed of developer. We're more versatile than specialized, and we deserve a community that understands that.
