                    | Hillary is a sophomore art sculpture student at New York University, and has already won all the major
                    | international prizes for new painters, including the Divinity Circle, the International Painter's Medal,
                    | and the Academy of Paris Award. Hillary's CAC exhibit features paintings that contain only water images
                    | including waves, deep sea, and river.

                    | An avid water sports participant, Hillary understands the water in many ways in which others do not, or
                    | may not ever have the opportunity. Her goal in creating the CAC exhibit was to share with others the
                    | beauty, power, and flow of natural bodies of water throughout the world. In addition to the display,
                    | Hilary also hosts a session on Tuesday called Deep Sea Wonders, which combines her love of deep sea diving
                    | and snorkeling, with instruction for capturing the beauty of underwater explorations on canvas.
